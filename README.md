# Artificial Intelligence
## Author: Rohan Singh

This repository is for my personal AI projects. The source code is in both **Java (Problem Solving using search)** and **Python (Machine Learning)**, the code in both of these directories can be used as a foundation for other AI programs that implement these algorithms. All of the source code in this directory is **made from scratch and doesn't use any external libraries like Scikit-Learn or Prophet.**

Other than the customizable templates for AI, there are also some projects that integrate these AI algorithms with real-applications, mostly games that are solved using AI algorithms.  

**AI-prereq:** The AI-prereq directory doesn't contain any AI-based alorithms, but just the basic stuff that people should know before they dive into the rest of the code. This includes a basics of python (pyplot) as well as Graph data structures. If you have experience in Python and Data Structures/Algorithms, you won't face any problem here.  

**The AI/ML Source Code directories:**  
1) **Problem Solving with Search: (Finished)**  
    - **Uninformed Search**: This includes depth-first, breadth-first traversals and uniform-cost search (Also in Python).  
    - **Informed Search:** This includes A* algorithm.    
    - **Search for Optimization:** This Hill Climb Search, Simulated Annealing and beam with k states.   
    
2) **Machine Learning: (In-progress)**    
    - **Clustering:**  Classifcation on Iris Dataset using KMeans.  
    - **Linear decision boundaries**  
    - **Neural Networks**  
    - **Learning Decision Boundaries using Optimization**  
  
3) **Decision Making under uncertainity and NLP:** *Not implemented yet*  
    - Sequential Decision Making  
    - Reinforcement Learning  
    - Natural Language Processing    
    
    
**AI-based Implementations:** *Eight puzzle (using A-star Algorithm and Local beam search)* Source code is in Java.
