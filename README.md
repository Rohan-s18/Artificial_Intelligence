# Artificial Intelligence
## Author: Rohan Singh

This repository is for my personal AI projects. The source code is in both **Java (Problem Solving using search)** and **Python (Machine Learning)**, the code in both of these directories can be used as a foundation for other AI programs that implement these algorithms.  

Other than the customizable templates for AI, there are also some projects that integrate these AI algorithms with real-applications, mostly games that are solved using AI algorithms.  

*Note:* The pyplot.py and GraphADT.py files are kept at the very beginning, because that code will be used in other algorithms and will be required a lot. 


**AI-based Implementations:** *Eight puzzle (using A-star Algorithm and Local beam search)* Source code is in Java.  

Content that I plan to put in this project:
1) **Problem Solving with Search: (Finished)**  
    - **Uninformed Search**: This includes depth-first, breadth-first traversals and uniform-cost search (Also in Python).  
    - **Informed Search:** This includes A* algorithm.    
    - **Search for Optimization:** This Hill Climb Search, Simulated Annealing and beam with k states.   
    
2) **Machine Learning: (In-progress)**    
    - **Clustering:**  Classifcation on Iris Dataset using KMeans.  
    - **Linear decision boundaries**  
    - **Neural Networks**  
    - **Learning Decision Boundaries using Optimization**  
  
3) Decision Making under uncertainity and NLP *Not implemented yet*
    (A) Sequential Decision Making\
    (B) Reinforcement Learning\
    (C) Natural Language Processing
