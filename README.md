# Artificial Intelligence
## Author: Rohan Singh
This repository is for my personal AI projects. Source code is in both **Java (under the CSDS391 directory)** and **Python (under the AI directory)**, the code in both of these directories can be used as templates for other AI programs that implement these algorithms. 
*Note:*The pyplot.py and GraphADT.py files are kept at the very beginning, because that code will be used in other algorithms and will be required a lot. 

Other than the customizable templates for AI, there are also some projects that integrate these AI algorithms with real-applications, mostly games that are solved using AI algorithms.

**Customizable Templates:** *A-star algorithm, Uninformed search, Informed search, Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing and local beam search.*


**AI-based Implementations:** *Eight puzzle (using A-star Algorithm and Local beam search)*
