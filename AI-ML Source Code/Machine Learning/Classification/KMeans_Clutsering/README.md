# KMeans Clustering
## November 2022
This is a bad attempt at trying to implement KMeans clustering using Python from Scratch. 
Unlike Scikit-Learn, you can actually customize this implementation to make it more robust and faster than Scikit-learn which takes a lot longer in order to get more accurate results.  
TL;DR Instead of Copy-Pasting or Just using Scikit-Learn, you can custmize this to your needs.
