# AI-based implementations
## Author: Rohan Singh
This directory contains the source code for applications of the AI Source Code in this repository. The source code in this directory cannot be used for general cases, but rather for specific implementations.  

## Content
This directory contains the following AI-based implementations:  
1) **Eight puzzle solver:** Source Code for an *Eight-Puzzle* solving algorithm. The source code includes both the game (which someone could play) as well as the solving algorithm. This was achieved using both A* search algorithm as well as k-states beam search. Source code is in Java.    
2) **Iris species classifier:** Source Code for classifying the *species of Iris flowers* given their petal/sepal dimensions. The Source Code is in Python and it includes:  
    - **Unsupervised Learning:** Used KMeans clustering to find the Iris species.  
    - **Neural Network:** Developoed a Neural Network to classify the species of Iris using logistic regression and optimized the neural network weights using gradient descent.  
    - **Multi Layer Perceptron:** This is not home-made code, but rather using Scikit-learn's Multi-Layer Perceptron to classify the different iris classes.
