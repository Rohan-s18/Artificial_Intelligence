# Neural Networks
## Author: Rohan Singh
This directory conteins the Source Code required for various types of Nerual Networks based on the number of parameters, layers, non-linearities and type of network. The source code in this directory is from scratch and doesn't use any external libraries like Scikit-Learn, FBProphet or Keras.

## Content
The Types of Neural Networks are divided into different directories:  
  - **Single Layer (Multi-input -> Single-output):** This directory contains source code for a general single layer n-to-1 neural network.   
  - **Single Layer (Multi-input -> Multi-output):** This directory contains source code for a general single layer n-to-m neural network.  
  - **Hidden Layer (Multi-input -> Single-output):** This directory contains source code for a general non-linearity (hidden layer) n-to-1 neural network.      
  - **Hidden Layer (Multi-input -> Multi-output):** This directory contains source code for a general non-linearity (hidden layer) n-to-m neural network.  
  - **Single Layer Perceptron:** This directory contains source code for a Single Layer Perceptron.
