# Eight Puzzle solver using Graph Search Algorithms
## Author: Rohan Singh

This Project contains the source code for an Eight Puzzle Solver using Graph Search algorithms. This contains source code, demonstration as well as test cases for the code. 
Source code is written in Java.

The source code contains:
1) Eight Puzzle game:-\
      (a) Set Board State\
      (b) Randomize Board State\
      (c) Move the blank tile up/down/left/right
2) Solve using A* algorithm:\
      (a) h1 heurestic: number of misplaced tiles.\
      (b) h2 heurestic: manhattan distance.
3) Solve using Local beam search with K-states  
4) Experiment: Conducting experiments on runtime, branching factor, effective branching factor for the different search algorithms used to solve the EightPuzzle.  

The solving algorithms show all of the steps to get to the final finished state.
